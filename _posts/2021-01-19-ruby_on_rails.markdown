For my first Ruby on Rails app I created a Farrier client management system which allows a Farrier to keep track of client information and appointments. It is so rewarding to build a project from ideation to completion.

I first came up with this project idea when I learned my first SQL statement. Even at the first introduction I found databases fascinating. And now, with the power of Rails, the options for creating seem limitless.

Coding every day has been a much needed and appreciated problem solving escape for my brain since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am so very thankful to have found this new and what will certainly be life-long passion.

Building a Rails API with a JavaScript frontend was both challenging and eye opening. It provided an opportunity to use everything that I have learned thus far in one Single Page Application (SPA). 

For my portfolio project I created a horse breeding app for a friend to store her mare and offspring information. This will allow her to track the genetics of her breeding mares. Now I just need to host it for her!

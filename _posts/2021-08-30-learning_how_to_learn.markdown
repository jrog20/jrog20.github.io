As I reflect on the past year of learning, I am smiling. The FlatIron program has been both challenging and rewarding. I have gained more from this program than I could have ever anticipated when signing up for the course. I wanted to learn a new skill. I wanted to learn how to code. I got that and so much more.

I have learnedâ€¦
* Patience
* Problem solving skills
* How to learn
* How to be a part of an online community
* To just keep going every day
* How to support myself and my community in an online learning environment
* If you can dream it, it can be built

In addition to all of these things, I also learned about Full Stack web development; Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux, and much, much more.

Although this is my last blog post as part of my FlatIron course, it is only really the beginning of my learning. I am excited to continue this life-long learning adventure. See you out there in code!

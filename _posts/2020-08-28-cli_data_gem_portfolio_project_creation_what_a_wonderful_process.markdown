Scraping websites. What can I say. It can be a challenge. And, when done successfully, can be very rewarding.

In the lessons and labs leading up to my first portfolio project, I found myself challenged at times and needing to ask the tech coaches for guidance. 

Asking for help in the scraping lab, I was greeted by a tech coach:

“Hi Jaime!”
“Oh…..scraping. Bye, Jaime!!”

After providing some much needed laughs and guidance, I was well on my way to scraping my first website. 

I have always been curious about coding. I have two brothers who grew up coding, however I had never coded a day in my life until the COVID-19 pandemic when I suddenly found myself with time available. If there was ever going to be a good time for me to explore this lifelong interest, it was now.

When given the option for my first portfolio project to scrape a website or use an API, I decided to scrape a local business website to get more scraping practice. 

What an amazing process it has been to create my first CLI Ruby gem. It was challenging and rewarding. I can’t wait to see what I will create next!

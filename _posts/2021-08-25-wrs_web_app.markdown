For my final project at FlatIron, I created, and will soon host, a Website for a local full-service equestrian facility. The frontend is in React and Redux, and the back end is a Rails API which allows for a user login so the barn staff can update a Post feed. The post feed will provide a place for barn staff to post photos and information on clinics, shows, training and other barn events.

This project has taught me so much. For starters, how to connect a Rails API with a React frontend. This was also my first time using Active Storage, which I found can be difficult to attach to a React frontend. After many attempts, the barn now has the ability to add images to their site. 

Although this is the end of my final project submission, it is nowhere near the end of my work on this project as I move to the next phase of reworking the final design and functionality and going through the process of hosting my first website. And then...on to building my next project!

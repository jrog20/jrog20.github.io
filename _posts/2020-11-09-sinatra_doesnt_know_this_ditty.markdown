Do you like solving problems? Do you like building things? Do you like seeing your hard work and problem solving skills make words and images appear on a screen? I do. And I've been enjoying all of these things while creating my first Sinatra CRUD MVC app. Essentially, I built a basic content management system. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic many organizations have shifted staff to work remotely from home. While many tools were already available and/or quickly developed to organize projects and communication within the remote workplace, the physical distance can still be hard for employees on a more personal level.

This app allows a user to create a login and post past personal adventures to share with colleagues while staying safe at home and giving each other something to connect on and look forward to the future when travel for pleasure will once again be commonplace. 

Rails (and post COVID-19 travel)...here I come.
